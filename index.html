            Claim:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Special education  are less likely to 
            graduate from high school. Its 20 
            percent less from the total graduation 
            rate in D.C.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Analysis:
        </h3>
        <p>
            I noticed that special education 
            students average of graduating is 52% 
            and it’s the lowest in D.C. The total 
            rate of D.C. graduation is 72% which is 
            higher than student with special 
            education.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Conclusion:
        </h3>
        <p class="idea">
            Students with special education are less 
            likely to graduate than the total 
            graduation rate in D.C. According to 
            “Greater Greater Washington”, “If you 
            select for special education students, 
            for example, you find that the top-ranked 
            school is a charter, Friendship 
            Collegiate”. They talk about how a charter 
            school is more likely to help a special 
            education student to graduate from high 
            school. In the picture below you can see 
            that the high graduation rate are charter 
            schools and there are less D.C. public 
            schools.<br><br> Wexler, N. (2015, March 18).
